        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>I'm from Chicago and have been watching different sports since I was
        little, so of course I love Chicago sports teams. Huge fan of the Bulls
        and the Bears. Really excited to see how the bulls do this time around
        this year with now new management in charge. I'm also a big soccer fan
        and some of my favorite European teams  include Real Madrid and
        Liverpool. I would say my favorite soccer  player is Cristiano Ronaldo
        and my favorite currently playing basketball player to be Stephen
        Curry.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I won't lie and say that I love all kinds of music genres, but I will
        say that I love music from many different genres. From Tyler the Creator
        and Kanye West to Asian Kung-Fu Generation and Unison Square  Garden, I
        would say my music taste varies a bit. Currently I know how to play two
        instruments, the guitar and the piano. Since I was little I had always
        wanted to learn how to play the guitar from seeing other family members
        also playing the guitar and so around the age of 8 was when I  first
        picked up the guitar to learn. Around the age of 15 or 16 in High School
        was when I first started to develop an interest in learning how to play
        the piano. I wasn't really inspired by anything or anyone to play the
        piano this time around, but I had always loved the sound of the piano
        notes and so I really wanted to give it a try and see if I could also
        play that instrument and ever since I've loved playing the piano.</p>
